## 🎯 About This Project

This repository demonstrates my **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** skills and comprehensive QA experience, including both **manual and automated testing**. As a **Web Developer** with strong QA expertise, I developed this currency exchange application from scratch and implemented a complete testing strategy covering all quality aspects.

**Live Application**: [https://wo-exchange-app.netlify.app/](https://wo-exchange-app.netlify.app/)

The application is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that can be installed and used on mobile devices like a native app, providing offline support and a seamless user experience.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This project showcases a **complete testing pyramid** with multiple testing types and tools, demonstrating proficiency in modern QA practices.

### Testing Types Implemented

| Test Type | Tool | Coverage | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| **Unit Tests** | Vitest + React Testing Library | 97%+ components | Validate individual components in isolation |
| **E2E Tests** | Cypress | Full user flows | Test complete user journeys with real API |
| **Cross-Browser E2E** | Playwright | Desktop + Mobile | Ensure compatibility across browsers and devices |
| **Contract Tests** | Pact | 7 interactions | Validate API contracts between consumer/provider |
| **Performance Tests** | K6 | Load + Browser | Measure performance and identify bottlenecks |
| **API Tests** | Cypress + Playwright | All endpoints | Validate API responses and error handling |

### Test Coverage Summary

```
Overall Coverage: 56.64%
